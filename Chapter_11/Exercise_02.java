/*
(The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee.
 - A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address.
 - A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant.
An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an
object for date hired.
 - A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title.
Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
