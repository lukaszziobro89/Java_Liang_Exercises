(Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v,
you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:
length = v^2 / 2a
Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a in
meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length.
